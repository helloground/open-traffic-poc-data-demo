<h1>A day on the roads of Manila</h1>
<h4>As captured from thousands of rideshare trips by Open Traffic and Mapzen Tangram</h4>

<hr>

Welcome to Manila, capital of the Philippines. Home to millions of people, this city is the most dense in the world by [some measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_population_density).

Manila and its surrounding metropolitan region are also home to some of the worst traffic in the world. As summed up by a newspaper headline at the start of 2016:

<a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/01/04/1539050/traffic-can-make-metro-manila-uninhabitable-4-years"><img src="manila-traffic-headline.png" alt="Traffic can make Metro Manila uninhabitable in 4 years"/></a>

Congestion like this is a profound limitation on the economy and the health of Manila. The World Bank [estimates](http://blogs.worldbank.org/eastasiapacific/philippines-traffic-woes-and-road-ahead) that as a result of its poor transportation network, Manila lost $18 billion in productivity, "an amount enough to fully plug underinvestment in infrastructure, education, and health." Manila also has poor air quality, in large part a result of all these vehicles. The Philippines is ranked as the 10th worst country in terms of deaths caused by air pollution, according to World Bank [findings](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/984261468327002120/Transport-for-health-the-global-burden-of-disease-from-motorized-road-transport).

And while harder to capture in statistics, when people are unable to get around, they can't visit their relatives as often, connect with their friends, and find amusement and opportunity.
